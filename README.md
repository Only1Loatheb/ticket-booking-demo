Call services
-------------

The user selects the day and the time when he/she would like to see the movie.

The system lists movies available in the given time interval - title and screening
times.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET -d "{\"from\":\"2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z\",\"to\":\"2021-10-05T14:48:00.000Z\"}" http://localhost:8080/movie
```

The user chooses a particular screening.

The system gives information regarding screening room and available seats.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET -d "{\"title\":\"Shrek\",\"start\":\"2021-06-01T18:30:00.000Z\"}" http://localhost:8080/screening
```

The user chooses seats, and gives the name of the person doing the reservation
(name and surname).

The system gives back the total amount to pay and reservation expiration time.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"userName\":\"Tomasz\",\"userSurname\":\"Zieli≈Ñski\",\"seats\":[{\"rowNo\":1,\"seatNo\":2}],\"screening\":{\"title\":\"Shrek\",\"start\":\"2021-06-01T18:30:00.000Z\",\"room\":1},\"tickets\":{\"adultTickets\":1,\"studentTickets\":0,\"childTickets\":0}}" http://localhost:8080/reservation
```

Scripts
-------

Scripts are located in [scripts](scripts) directory.
You can execute them with bash.

I advise you to run the app in one terminal and execute tests or use case in another one.
